How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
All users are not created equally and neither are their stories. I find that drawing a picture with captions, or even a short comic strip, can aid in visualizing what the user has in their mind. Putting yourself in the shoes of the user is hard, but can be extremely useful in writing specific requests into the project. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Just as you would when writing a paper, I would take notes first. Next, I would compile these notes into an organized list, or backlog in this case. From that backlog I would break my backlog up and begin working on sections to build the basic framework for the program first. Once the program was functional in a basic fashion, I would begin tailoring the program to the customers wants and needs.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
The same as it means to be a good team member in any industry. Communicate with your team, provide feedback, assist them when needed, take criticism, and more. The list is long but in the end, everyone has the same goal and should be courteous and respectful to one another both personally and professionally.
